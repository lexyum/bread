# x64 print functions

Buffering print functions bprints, lbprints, bprintc, lbprintc, for slightly easier asm output without linking against the C standard library. Written in x86_64 assembly, nasm (intel) syntax, using the 64-bit Linux calling conventions

## Compilation/linking
The shell script `comp' compiles and links the test programs - saves a bit of typing overall
